//! Example MM Supervisor Binary for QEMU Q35
//!
//! This is an example platform binary that demonstrates how to build a PE/COFF
//! MM Supervisor using the `patina_mm_supervisor` crate.
//!
//! ## Building
//!
//! Build with cargo for the UEFI target:
//! ```bash
//! cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-uefi --bin q35_mm_supervisor --features x64,save_state_amd,supv --no-default-features
//! ```
//!
//! ## Entry Point
//!
//! The MM Supervisor is handed off by the MM IPL (Initial Program Loader) after:
//! - Page tables are set up
//! - The supervisor image is loaded into MMRAM
//! - A HOB list is constructed with MMRAM ranges and other configuration
//!
//! The entry point `MmSupervisorMain` is called on ALL processors simultaneously.
//! The first processor to arrive becomes the BSP, others become APs.
//!
